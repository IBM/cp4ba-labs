# IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions

## Overview

IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions (BAMOE) is a Business Automation foundational platform for developing, deploying, managing, and monitoring Enterprise-grade, cloud-native Business Services in hybrid cloud environments, such as Red Hat® OpenShift® and Kubernetes.

IBM BAMOE is based on Open-Source Apache KIE technologies such as Drools, jBPM, and Kogito, and provides a set of libraries, applications and tools that adapt to your Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and integrate with services and technologies that you are probably already using (VS Code, Git-based source code hosting services, event streaming platforms such as Apache Kafka, popular microservice monitoring and metrics technologies such as Prometheus).
