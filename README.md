# IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation Labs

To be able to perform these labs, you need to have IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation (either Enterprise or Starter pattern) installed and have imported the Client Onboarding scenario as described [here](https://github.com/IBM/cp4ba-client-onboarding-scenario).

A fast way for Business Partners and IBMers with access to IBM TechZone, is to utilize [Jam-in-a-Box](http://ibm.biz/Jam-in-a-Box) with its associated environment. Another way is to deploy an IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation Enterprise pattern cluster using the rapid deployment scripts as describes [here](https://github.com/IBM/cp4ba-rapid-deployment). 

There are labs available for the following IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation versions:
