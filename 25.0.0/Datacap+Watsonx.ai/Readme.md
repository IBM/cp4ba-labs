# IBM Datacap + Watsonx.ai
## Overview
>  IBM Datacap is a powerful document capture and data extraction platform designed to automate the ingestion, classification, and processing of structured and unstructured documents. It helps organizations reduce manual data entry, improve accuracy, and accelerate workflows.
>
>  The integration between IBM Datacap and watsonx.ai enables organizations to apply AI-powered capabilities to document capture workflows. This pairing is designed to improve automation, accuracy, and flexibility in handling complex documents.
>
> **Capabilities Enabled by watsonx.ai**
     - Natural language understanding: Extracts meaning from unstructured text.
     - Semantic classification: Identifies document types based on context, not just layout.
     - Prompt-based extraction: Developers can craft prompts to extract specific data points (e.g., invoice totals, contract terms).
     - Model flexibility: Choose from IBM-hosted models or bring your own via watsonx.ai
>
> **Benefits of the Integration**
    Improved accuracy in data extraction from complex or variable documents.
    Reduced template dependency, thanks to AI-driven understanding.
    Faster deployment of new document types using prompt engineering.
    Scalable intelligence across high-volume capture environments.
## Labs
> Build a capture solution using IBM Datacap integrated with watsonx.ai.. In this hands-on session, you will configure your own intelligent document processing project. You’ll define fields for data extraction, create rules, and—where supported—leverage watsonx.ai foundational large language models (LLMs) to automate complex data classification and data extraction.
> 
> Discover how to enhance your capture workflow by integrating prompt-driven AI from watsonx.ai directly into Datacap. This lab shows you how LLMs can improve accuracy, reduce reliance on templates, and streamline document classification and data extraction for real-world applications.
