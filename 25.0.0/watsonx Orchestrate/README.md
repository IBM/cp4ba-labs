# IBM watsonx Orchestrate
## Overview
Building on the labâ€™s core objective of developing an upsell campaign solution, attendees will learn how to leverage the watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK) to create intelligent agents capable of dynamic user interaction and seamless integration with external systems. These agents will be designed to autonomously execute tasks within a broader workflow, demonstrating how AI-powered automation can streamline business operations through orchestration and system interoperability. 

## Labs

### **Track 2 - Developer Role / Solution Implementation** 

- **[Build Upsell Services Campaign AI Agent with IBM watsonx Orchestrate.](Build%20Upsell%20Services%20Campaign%20AI%20Agent%20with%20IBM%20watsonx%20Orchestrate.pdf):** In this lab, you will build an IBM watsonx Orchestrate solution that re-imagines the quarterly promotions process. You will reuse the existing IT assets implemented with IBM Business Automation Workflow to author an Agent that automates the Upsell Campaign. The Services Upsell Campaign Agent (CSU Agent, for short) will guide sales representatives through the upsell campaign steps, pull customer data from the system of record, and create targeted emails.
